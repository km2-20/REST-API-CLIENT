*DESCRIPTION*:

The *Weather API Client* project is a Java application designed to fetch and display weather data from the OpenWeatherMap public REST API. It handles HTTP GET requests to retrieve weather information based on a user-provided city, parses the JSON response, and allows the user to view data in a structured format. The application gives the user the ability to choose from various display options, such as 
1. *temperature*
2. *full weather reports* or 
3. *additional details - like humidity*
4. *wind speed* and
5. *pressure* 

By handling the HTTP request, parsing the JSON response, and displaying the data in a user-friendly manner, the program ensures that users can easily obtain and understand weather information. Error handling is also incorporated to manage situations like invalid city names or network issues. Overall, the project demonstrates a practical implementation of consuming public APIs, parsing JSON data, and presenting it in a clear and customizable format.
